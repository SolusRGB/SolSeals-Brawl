            <h3>How can I trust the brawl game?</h3>
            <p>
              Our brawl operates on-chain, meaning this increases security and
              transparency since the transactions cannot be altered once they
              are verified and recorded on the network. Hosting PVP games
              removes the need for a house wallet, which is often a huge target
              for blockchain hackers. This means that all funds that flow
              through the casino are 100% safe and at no risk of being
              compromised.

              <h3>Why are my results not always instant?</h3>
              <p>
                Our brawl is PvP meaning that you are playing against another
                real player. Therefore, if you place a bet and no one else has
                placed one for the same amount as you, you will be placed into a
                queue until you find a match. The instant icon means that there
                is already a player waiting in the queue, therefore, you will be
                instantly matched against them and not have to wait for another
                player.

              <h3>What are my odds of winning/What are the fees?</h3>
              <p>
                Every player has a 50/50 chance of winning! A tiny fee of 3.5%
                is charged on each transaction to support the upkeep and
                development of the game.

                Only ever bet with Sol you can afford to lose. If you feel that
                you can not stop yourself from using the casino please reach out
                to any member of our team and we will blacklist your wallet for
                you.
