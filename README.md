This is a preview application of Road Rugger with included Partner Support.

In the future This will be ported to a library so that you don't have to work inside this messy repo.

To run locally:
Ensure you have Node.JS installed and have yarn.

run:
`yarn`
`yarn dev`

This will run a local application.

To deploy: I recommend using Vercel, it's as simple as just hooking it up.
